# PTN Ninja

Fork of [PTN Ninja](https://github.com/gruppler/PTN-Ninja) where I hacked in support for asynchronous multiplayer. Quick demo [here](https://youtu.be/l9eG4L--LmY). This is only the client-side code; it communicates with a server, which is available [here TODO:upload and link server code]. This work is unfinished, as @gruppler is [working](https://github.com/gruppler/PTN-Ninja/issues/22) on multiplayer himself.
